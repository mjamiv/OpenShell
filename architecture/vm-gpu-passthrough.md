# VM GPU Passthrough

> Status: Experimental and work in progress (WIP). GPU passthrough for the VM backend is under active development.

## Overview

OpenShell's VM backend can pass a physical NVIDIA GPU into a microVM using VFIO (Virtual Function I/O). This gives the guest direct access to GPU hardware, enabling CUDA workloads and `nvidia-smi` inside sandboxes without virtualization overhead.

GPU passthrough uses cloud-hypervisor (instead of the default libkrun backend) to attach a VFIO device to the VM. The guest sees a real PCI GPU device and loads standard NVIDIA drivers.

## Architecture

```

### Backend selection

| Flag | Backend | GPU attached? |
|------|---------|---------------|
| (none) | libkrun | No |
| `--gpu` | cloud-hypervisor | Yes (auto-detect and bind) |
| `--gpu 0000:41:00.0` | cloud-hypervisor | Yes (specific PCI device) |
| `--backend cloud-hypervisor` | cloud-hypervisor | No (force CHV without GPU) |

Auto mode (`--backend auto`, the default) selects cloud-hypervisor when `--gpu` is used or a VFIO PCI address is configured. Otherwise libkrun is used.

### Automatic GPU binding

When `--gpu` is passed (with or without a specific PCI address), the launcher automatically prepares the GPU for VFIO passthrough:

1. **Probe** — scans `/sys/bus/pci/devices` for NVIDIA devices (vendor `0x10de`).
2. **Safety checks** — for each candidate GPU, verifies it is safe to claim (see below). If any check fails, the launcher refuses to proceed and exits with an actionable error.
3. **Bind** — unbinds the selected GPU from the `nvidia` driver and binds it to `vfio-pci`. Also binds any IOMMU group peers to `vfio-pci` for group cleanliness.
4. **Launch** — starts cloud-hypervisor with the VFIO device attached and sets `GPU_ENABLED=true` in the guest kernel cmdline.
5. **Rebind on shutdown** — when the VM exits (clean shutdown, Ctrl+C, or crash), the launcher rebinds the GPU back to the `nvidia` driver and clears `driver_override`, restoring host GPU access. Cleanup is guaranteed by a `GpuBindGuard` RAII guard that calls restore on drop, covering normal exit, early return, and panic. Only `SIGKILL` (kill -9) bypasses the guard — see Troubleshooting below for manual recovery.

When a specific PCI address is given (`--gpu 0000:41:00.0`), the launcher targets that exact device. When `--gpu` is used without an address (`auto` mode), the launcher selects the best available GPU using the multi-GPU selection strategy.

### Safety checks

All safety checks are hard failures — if any check fails, the launcher prints an error and exits without binding. There is no `--force` override.

| Check | What it detects | Failure behavior |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Display attached** | GPU drives an active DRM framebuffer or is the primary rendering device | Error: "GPU 0000:xx:xx.x has active display outputs — cannot passthrough without losing host display" |
| **Active processes** | Processes holding `/dev/nvidia*` file descriptors (CUDA jobs, monitoring) | Error: "GPU 0000:xx:xx.x is in use by PID(s) — stop these processes first" |
| **IOMMU enabled** | `/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/` exists and the GPU has a group assignment | Error: "IOMMU is not enabled — add intel_iommu=on or amd_iommu=on to kernel cmdline" |
| **VFIO modules loaded** | `vfio-pci` and `vfio_iommu_type1` kernel modules are loaded | Error: "vfio-pci kernel module not loaded — run: sudo modprobe vfio-pci" |
| **Permissions** | Write access to sysfs bind/unbind and `/dev/vfio/` | Error: "insufficient permissions — run as root or with CAP_NET_ADMIN" |

### Multi-GPU selection (`--gpu` auto mode)

On hosts with multiple NVIDIA GPUs, the launcher selects a GPU using this priority:

1. **Already on vfio-pci** with a clean IOMMU group — use immediately (no rebind needed).
2. **Idle (no processes, no display)** — preferred for binding.
3. **Skip** GPUs with active displays or running processes.

If no GPU passes all safety checks, the launcher fails with per-device status listing what blocked each GPU.

## Host preparation

The launcher handles GPU driver binding automatically. The host only needs IOMMU and VFIO kernel modules configured.

### 1. Enable IOMMU

IOMMU must be enabled in both BIOS/UEFI and the Linux kernel.

**Intel systems:**

```shell
# Add to kernel command line (e.g. /etc/default/grub GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX)
intel_iommu=on iommu=pt
```

**AMD systems:**

```shell
# AMD IOMMU is usually enabled by default; verify or add:
amd_iommu=on iommu=pt
```

After editing, run `update-grub` (or equivalent) and reboot. Verify IOMMU is active:

```shell
dmesg | grep -i iommu
# Should show: "DMAR: IOMMU enabled" or "AMD-Vi: AMD IOMMUv2"
```

### 2. Load VFIO kernel modules

```shell
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
sudo modprobe vfio_iommu_type1

# Persist across reboots
echo "vfio-pci" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/vfio-pci.conf
echo "vfio_iommu_type1" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/vfio_iommu_type1.conf
```

### 3. Device permissions

The launcher needs root (or `CAP_NET_ADMIN`) to bind/unbind GPU drivers and configure TAP networking:

```shell
# Option A: run as root (simplest)
sudo openshell-vm --gpu

# Option B: set udev rules for /dev/vfio/ access (still needs sysfs write via root)
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="vfio", OWNER="root", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0660"' | \
  sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-vfio.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
```

### What the launcher does automatically

When `--gpu` is passed, the launcher performs the following steps that previously required manual intervention:

1. **Identifies NVIDIA GPUs** via sysfs (`/sys/bus/pci/devices/*/vendor`)
2. **Runs safety checks** — display, active processes, IOMMU, VFIO modules (see Safety checks above)
3. **Unbinds from nvidia** — writes to `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/driver/unbind`
4. **Sets driver override** — writes `vfio-pci` to `/sys/bus/pci/devices/<BDF>/driver_override`
5. **Binds to vfio-pci** — writes to `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/vfio-pci/bind`
6. **Handles IOMMU group peers** — binds other devices in the same IOMMU group to `vfio-pci`
7. **On shutdown** — reverses all bindings, clears `driver_override`, rebinds to `nvidia`

## Single-GPU caveats

When the host has only one NVIDIA GPU:

- **Display-attached GPUs are blocked.** The safety checks detect if the GPU drives an active display (DRM framebuffer). If so, the launcher refuses to bind it — this prevents accidentally killing the host desktop. On headless data center servers (the typical deployment), this check passes and the GPU is bound automatically.
- **Recovery is automatic.** When the VM exits (clean shutdown, Ctrl+C, or process crash), the launcher rebinds the GPU to the `nvidia` driver and clears `driver_override`. No manual intervention is needed.
- **Process check.** If CUDA processes are using the GPU (visible via `/dev/nvidia*` file descriptors), the launcher refuses to unbind. Stop those processes first.

## Supported GPUs

GPU passthrough is validated with NVIDIA data center GPUs. Consumer GPUs may work but are not officially supported (NVIDIA restricts GeForce passthrough in some driver versions).

| GPU | Architecture | Compute Capability | Status |
|-----|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| A100 | Ampere | 8.0 | Supported |
| A30 | Ampere | 8.0 | Supported |
| H100 | Hopper | 9.0 | Supported |
| H200 | Hopper | 9.0 | Supported |
| L40 | Ada Lovelace | 8.9 | Supported |
| L40S | Ada Lovelace | 8.9 | Supported |
| L4 | Ada Lovelace | 8.9 | Supported |

## CLI usage

### Auto-select GPU

```shell
# openshell-vm binary (VM backend directly) — auto-detects, binds, and rebinds on exit
sudo openshell-vm --gpu

# openshell CLI (gateway deployment)
sudo openshell gateway start --gpu
```

### Specific PCI address (multi-GPU hosts)

```shell
sudo openshell-vm --gpu 0000:41:00.0
sudo openshell gateway start --gpu 0000:41:00.0
```

### Diagnostics

When `--gpu` is passed, the launcher probes and reports what it finds. If safety checks fail, it exits with an actionable error:

```
$ sudo openshell gateway start --gpu
Error: GPU passthrough blocked by safety checks.

  Detected devices:
    0000:41:00.0: has active display outputs (DRM framebuffer attached)
    0000:42:00.0: in use by PIDs: 12345 (python3), 12400 (nvidia-smi)

  No GPU is available for passthrough. To resolve:
    - 0000:41:00.0: detach the display or use a different GPU for the monitor
    - 0000:42:00.0: stop processes using the GPU, then retry
```

On a headless server with an idle GPU, binding succeeds silently:

```
$ sudo openshell gateway start --gpu
GPU: binding 0000:41:00.0 to vfio-pci (was: nvidia)
GPU: IOMMU group 15 clean (1 device)
...
Ready [16.8s total]
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
^C
GPU: rebinding 0000:41:00.0 to nvidia
```

## VM Networking (Cloud Hypervisor)

Cloud Hypervisor uses TAP-based networking instead of the gvproxy user-mode networking used by the libkrun backend. This has several implications for connectivity and port forwarding.

### Network topology

```
Host                                   Guest (microVM)
─────────────────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────
  eth0 (or primary NIC)                  eth0 (virtio-net)
  ↕                                      ↕
  iptables MASQUERADE ←── NAT ──→        192.168.249.2/24
  ↕                                      ↕ default gw 192.168.249.1
  vmtap0 (TAP device)                   ↕
  192.168.249.1/24 ←─── L2 bridge ──→   (kernel routes)
                                         ↕
  127.0.0.1:{port} ←── TCP proxy ──→    {port} (k3s NodePort)
```

### How it works

The CHV backend configures networking in three layers:

**1. TAP device and guest IP assignment**

Cloud Hypervisor creates a TAP device on the host side with IP `192.168.249.1/24`. The guest is assigned `192.168.249.2/24` via kernel command line parameters (`VM_NET_IP`, `VM_NET_GW`, `VM_NET_DNS`). The init script reads these from `/proc/cmdline` and uses them as the static fallback when DHCP is unavailable (CHV does not run a DHCP server).

**2. Host-side NAT and IP forwarding**

After booting the VM, the launcher:
- Enables IP forwarding (`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`)
- Adds iptables MASQUERADE rules for the `192.168.249.0/24` subnet
- Adds FORWARD rules to allow traffic to/from the VM

This gives the guest internet access through the host. Rules are cleaned up on VM shutdown.

**3. TCP port forwarding**

Unlike gvproxy (which provides built-in port forwarding), CHV TAP networking requires explicit port forwarding. The launcher starts a userspace TCP proxy for each port mapping (e.g., `30051:30051`). The proxy binds to `127.0.0.1:{host_port}` and forwards connections to `192.168.249.2:{guest_port}`.

### DNS resolution

The launcher detects the host's upstream DNS server using a two-step lookup:

1. Reads `/etc/resolv.conf` and picks the first nameserver that does not start with `127.` (skipping systemd-resolved's `127.0.0.53` stub and other loopback addresses).
2. If all nameservers in `/etc/resolv.conf` are loopback, falls back to `/run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf` (the upstream resolv.conf maintained by systemd-resolved).
3. If no non-loopback nameserver is found in either file, falls back to `8.8.8.8`.

The resolved DNS server is passed to the guest via `VM_NET_DNS=` on the kernel command line. The init script writes it to `/etc/resolv.conf` inside the guest, unconditionally overriding any stale entries from previous boot cycles.

### Key constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `CHV_TAP_HOST_IP` | `192.168.249.1` | Host side of the TAP device |
| `CHV_TAP_GUEST_IP` | `192.168.249.2` | Guest static IP |
| `CHV_TAP_SUBNET` | `192.168.249.0/24` | Subnet for iptables rules |
| `CHV_TAP_NETMASK` | `255.255.255.0` | Subnet mask in VM payload |

### Differences from libkrun/gvproxy networking

| Feature | libkrun + gvproxy | CHV + TAP |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| Network mode | User-mode (SLIRP-like) | Kernel TAP device |
| DHCP | Built-in (gvproxy) | None (static IP via cmdline) |
| Guest IP | `192.168.127.2/24` | `192.168.249.2/24` |
| Port forwarding | Built-in (gvproxy `-forward`) | Userspace TCP proxy |
| Privileges | Unprivileged | Root or `CAP_NET_ADMIN` |
| NAT | Handled by gvproxy | iptables MASQUERADE |
| DNS | gvproxy provides | Host resolver passed via cmdline |

### Troubleshooting networking

**"lookup registry-1.docker.io: Try again" (DNS failure)**

The VM cannot resolve DNS. Check:

```shell
# Verify the host DNS is non-loopback
grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf
# If only 127.0.0.53 (systemd-resolved), find the upstream:
resolvectl status | grep 'DNS Servers'

# Verify iptables rules are in place
sudo iptables -t nat -L POSTROUTING -n -v | grep 192.168.249
sudo iptables -L FORWARD -n -v | grep 192.168.249

# Verify IP forwarding is enabled
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

**Gateway health check fails (port 30051 unreachable)**

The TCP port forwarder may not have started, or the guest service is not yet listening:

```shell
# Check if the port forwarder is bound on the host
ss -tlnp | grep 30051

# Check if the guest is reachable
ping -c1 192.168.249.2
```

### Host mTLS cache and state disk

The launcher caches mTLS certificates on the host after the first successful boot (warm boot path). If the state disk is deleted or `--reset` is used, the VM generates new PKI that won't match the cached certs. The launcher detects this — when the state disk is freshly created or reset, it clears the stale host mTLS cache and runs the cold-boot PKI fetch path. This prevents `transport error` failures on the gateway health check after a state disk reset.

## Troubleshooting

### "No NVIDIA PCI device found"

The host has no NVIDIA GPU installed, or the PCI device is not visible:

```shell
lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia
# If empty, the GPU is not detected at the PCI level
```

### "has active display outputs"

The GPU drives a DRM framebuffer (display is attached). This is a hard safety check — the launcher will not unbind a display GPU. Options:

- Use a different GPU for the monitor (iGPU, secondary card)
- On headless servers, this should not occur — verify with `ls /sys/class/drm/card*/device`

### "in use by PIDs: ..."

Active processes hold `/dev/nvidia*` file descriptors. The launcher lists the PIDs and process names. Stop those processes before retrying.

### "IOMMU is not enabled"

IOMMU must be enabled in both BIOS/UEFI and kernel cmdline. See Host Preparation above.

### "vfio-pci kernel module not loaded"

```shell
sudo modprobe vfio-pci
sudo modprobe vfio_iommu_type1
```

### "Permission denied" / "insufficient permissions"

The launcher needs root to write to sysfs bind/unbind paths. Run with `sudo`.

### GPU not rebound after crash

If the launcher process is killed with `SIGKILL` (kill -9), the cleanup handler cannot run and the GPU remains on `vfio-pci`. Manually rebind:

```shell
PCI_ADDR="0000:41:00.0"
echo "$PCI_ADDR" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PCI_ADDR/driver/unbind
echo "" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/devices/$PCI_ADDR/driver_override
echo "$PCI_ADDR" | sudo tee /sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia/bind
```

### nvidia driver unbind deadlock (kernel bug)

Some nvidia driver versions deadlock in their sysfs `unbind` handler — the `write()` syscall to `/sys/bus/pci/drivers/nvidia/unbind` never returns. When this happens, the process enters uninterruptible sleep (D state) and becomes unkillable even by `SIGKILL`. The GPU's PCI subsystem state is corrupted and all subsequent PCI operations on the device hang. Only a host reboot clears this state.

This is a kernel/nvidia driver bug, not an openshell-vm issue. To mitigate this, the launcher performs sysfs unbind/bind writes in a forked subprocess with a timeout (default 10 seconds). If the subprocess hangs:

- The parent process kills the subprocess and reports a clear error instead of hanging itself.
- The GPU may be left in an indeterminate state — a reboot may be required.
- The launcher remains responsive and can clean up other resources.

If you hit this issue repeatedly, check for nvidia driver updates or file a bug with NVIDIA. Running `nvidia-smi` before unbinding can sometimes clear stale driver state.

### VM boots but `nvidia-smi` fails inside guest

- Verify the GPU rootfs includes NVIDIA drivers: `chroot /path/to/rootfs which nvidia-smi`
- Check that NVIDIA kernel modules load: `openshell-vm exec <name> -- lsmod | grep nvidia`
- Inspect dmesg for NVIDIA driver errors: `openshell-vm exec <name> -- dmesg | grep -i nvidia`
